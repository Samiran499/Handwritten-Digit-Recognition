# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
It's a digit recognition prototype created using Keras and trained on MNIST datasheet

There are two implementation code on ipy notebook and python code. The python code is the improved version, specifically for testing the model as it loads the pre-trained model (for 1000 epochs and batch size of 1024).
